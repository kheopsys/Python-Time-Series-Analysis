# Python-Time-Series-Analysis

A time series is a series of data points indexed in time order. The sequence of data points taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Examples of time series are daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average or number of sales of shampoo over a 3 year period.

Time series are very frequently in statistics, signal processing, pattern recognition, mathematical finance, control engineering, astronomy, communications engineering, and largely in any domain of applied science and engineering which involves temporal measurements.

Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Methods for time series analysis may be divided into several category including frequency-domain methods or time-domain methods. In this project, we're going to focus on time-domain methods which are widely used to predict future values based on previously observed values.

We will use __Pandas__ and the __Statsmodels__ library wich are powerful Python tool to process time series data.

The project cover following topics:

- Binary classification
- Multiclass classification
- Regression
- Auto-Encoder
- Denoizing Auto-Encoder
- RNN (LSTM)
- CNN
- GAN

Each topic will refers to Notebook example. The example assume that reader are familiar with statics concepts and Python.
